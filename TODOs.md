# TODOs To Get Done

Get the April 28th Dataset
Scans 11 and 12 are best according to David. (Scan 11 isn't in the folder? But I got scans 12, 13, and 14) ✔️

Solve the polar space issue (scaling and whitespace). ✔️

Integrate the scansets into the tool. ✔️

Dynamically add/remove PPI and RHI views. ✔️

Make a cleanup and documentation pass on everything.

Switching products. Back when we were using matplotlib, it was nice to have a right-click context menu. In VisPy that seems a lot more difficult. I hate to put it buried in the menubar. Need to figure this out.

Hook up the volume_slice_selector to the plots. Partially complete!

Every time a new volume is loaded, the selected indexes in the volume slice seletor are cleared. This is probably because I recreate it every time the volume changes.

Get the "play" button working.
